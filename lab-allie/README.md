##Lab 2: Using the call, bind, and apply methods

The first goal of this lab is to create a module.exports object, create a basic function, then attach the call, bind, and apply methods to the initial function.

The second goal of this lab is to write tests for these methods and check those tests using Mocha in the command line. Mocha has been included as a dependency, as well as eslint for command line linting.

*Comments: This lab was more straightforward than I initially realized. I was overthinking the methods and how to write tests for them. Looking back, I see the value of writing multiple tests that each test for something small and specific, instead of larger tests.
